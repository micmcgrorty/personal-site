# Personal Site

My personal site, built in Remix.

## Shape

- `app/actions/controller.tsx` owns the top-level route actions.
- `app/actions/home-page.tsx` and `app/actions/document.tsx` render the UI.
- `app/actions/public/` contains the browser runtime entry.
- `app/routes.ts` defines the shared route contract used by server and browser modules for type-safe hrefs.
- `app/router.ts` wires routes to handlers and installs the standard Remix component renderer used by actions.
- `app/assets.ts` owns the server-side asset pipeline used by the asset route and render middleware.
- Root `public/` contains static files served unchanged from the app root.
